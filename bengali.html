                            <br>2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)
                            <br>2 tablespoons ghee or oil
                            <br>1/2 teaspoon salt

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Dough:</b><br>
                            In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, ghee or oil, and salt. Mix well until the flour is crumbly.
                            Gradually add warm water and knead the dough until it is smooth and soft. The dough should not be too sticky or too dry.
                            Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Shaping the Luchi:</b><br>
                            After the dough has rested, divide it into small lemon-sized balls.
                            Roll each ball into a smooth ball and flatten it slightly with your hands.
                            On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball into a thin circle about 4-5 inches in diameter. Make sure the luchi is not too thick.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Frying the Luchi:</b><br>
                            Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-high heat.
                            To check if the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of dough into the oil. If it rises to the surface quickly and puffs up, the oil is ready.
                            Carefully slide one rolled luchi into the hot oil. It should puff up immediately.
                            Gently press the luchi with a slotted spoon to help it puff up fully.
                            Fry until both sides are golden brown, then remove the luchi with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
                            Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve hot luchis with aloo dum, chole, or any curry of your choice.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparation:</b><br>
                            Soak the bitter gourd slices in salted water for 15-20 minutes. Drain and rinse them thoroughly before using to reduce bitterness.
                            Heat mustard oil in a deep pan or kadai over medium heat.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Vegetables:</b><br>
                            Add paanch phoron (Bengali five-spice blend) to the hot oil and let it splutter.
                            Add all the sliced vegetables (bitter gourd, raw banana, potato, ridge gourd, eggplant, drumsticks, and green beans).
                            Stir-fry the vegetables for 5-7 minutes until they start to soften.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making the Gravy:</b><br>
                            Add turmeric powder and salt to the vegetables. Mix well.
                            Add the mustard paste and poppy seed paste to the pan. Stir to coat the vegetables evenly.
                            Pour in the milk gradually while stirring continuously to form a creamy gravy.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Simmering:</b><br>
                            Lower the heat and let the shukto simmer gently for 10-15 minutes until the vegetables are cooked through and the flavors have blended well.
                            If desired, add a tablespoon of ghee and a pinch of sugar to balance the flavors.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve hot Shukto as a starter or side dish with steamed rice.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Malpua Batter:</b><br>
                            In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, semolina, milk powder, baking powder, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using).
                            Gradually add milk while stirring to make a thick batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter.
                            Cover the batter and let it rest for 30 minutes.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making the Sugar Syrup:</b><br>
                            In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
                            Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using). Simmer for 5-7 minutes until the syrup thickens slightly.
                            Remove from heat and add a few drops of rose water or kewra water for fragrance (if using). Keep the syrup warm.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Frying the Malpua:</b><br>
                            Heat ghee or oil in a shallow frying pan or skillet over medium heat.
                            Pour a ladleful of batter into the hot ghee/oil to form a small pancake (about 3-4 inches in diameter).
                            Fry until the bottom side is golden brown, then flip and fry the other side until golden brown and cooked through.
                            Remove the malpua from the ghee/oil and drain excess oil by placing it on paper towels.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Soaking the Malpua:</b><br>
                            Immediately immerse the fried malpua in the warm sugar syrup. Allow it to soak for 1-2 minutes, flipping once to ensure both sides are coated with syrup.
                            Remove the malpua from the syrup and place it on a serving plate.<br><br>

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Caramelized Milk:</b><br>
                            In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the milk over medium-high heat until it comes to a boil.
                            Stir occasionally to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
                            Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the milk reduces to about half its original volume. Keep an eye on it to prevent it from boiling over.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Caramelizing the Sugar:</b><br>
                            In a separate pan, heat the sugar over medium heat. Stir continuously until the sugar melts and turns into a golden-brown caramel.
                            Be careful not to burn the sugar. Once caramelized, remove the pan from heat.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Mixing Caramelized Sugar with Milk:</b><br>
                            Gradually add the caramelized sugar to the simmering milk, stirring continuously until well combined.
                            Continue to simmer for another 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to incorporate the caramel into the milk.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooling and Fermenting:</b><br>
                            Allow the milk mixture to cool down until it is warm to the touch but not hot.
                            In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt with a few tablespoons of the warm milk mixture to temper the yogurt.
                            Add the tempered yogurt mixture back into the remaining warm milk mixture and mix well.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Incubation:</b><br>
                            Transfer the milk-yogurt mixture into clean earthenware pots or any container with a lid.
                            Cover the containers with a clean cloth or lid and place them in a warm, draft-free place to ferment. The fermentation process typically takes 6-8 hours or overnight, depending on the temperature and climate.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Chilling and Serving:</b><br>
                            Once the Misti Doi is set and firm, refrigerate it for a few hours to chill.
                            Serve chilled Misti Doi garnished with chopped nuts (like pistachios or almonds) if desired.

                            In a large pot, bring 1 liter of milk to a boil over medium heat.
                            Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat and add lemon juice or vinegar gradually, stirring continuously, until the milk curdles and greenish whey separates from the milk solids (paneer).
                            Turn off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes.
                            Strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth or fine sieve. Rinse the paneer under cold water to remove the sour taste of lemon juice or vinegar. Squeeze out excess water and hang the paneer in the cloth for 30 minutes to drain excess water.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Kneading and Shaping Paneer Balls:</b><br>
                            Transfer the drained paneer onto a clean, flat surface. Knead the paneer for 5-7 minutes until smooth and soft.
                            Divide the paneer into equal-sized small balls and flatten slightly to form discs or balls.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Boiling Paneer Balls (Rasgullas):</b><br>
                            In a wide pan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
                            Add sugar and stir until dissolved.
                            Gently slide the paneer balls into the boiling sugar water.
                            Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes on medium heat until the paneer balls double in size and become spongy.
                            Turn off the heat and let the paneer balls cool in the sugar syrup. Add ice cubes to speed up the cooling process.<br><br>

                            In another wide pan, bring 1 liter of milk to a boil over medium heat.
                            Stir occasionally to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
                            Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the milk reduces to about half its original volume.
                            Add sugar, cardamom powder, and soaked saffron (along with milk) to the thickened milk. Mix well and simmer for another 5-7 minutes.<br><br>

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Soaking Paneer Balls:</b><br>
                            Gently squeeze out the sugar syrup from the paneer balls and transfer them to the thickened sweetened milk (ras).
                            Let the paneer balls soak in the ras for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator to absorb the flavors.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Chilling and Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve chilled Rasmalai garnished with chopped nuts (like pistachios, almonds) on top.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Prepare the Chenna (Paneer):</b><br>
                            Boil the milk in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat.
                            Once it boils, add lemon juice or vinegar gradually while stirring until the milk curdles completely.
                            Turn off the heat once the whey (greenish water) separates from the curd (white milk solids).
                            Strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth or a fine sieve. Rinse the chenna under cold water to remove any sourness from the lemon juice or vinegar.
                            Tie the cloth with chenna and hang it for 30 minutes to drain excess water.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Knead the Chenna:</b><br>
                            Transfer the chenna to a clean surface or a plate. Knead it with the heels of your hands until it becomes smooth and soft. This should take about 7-10 minutes. The texture should be like a smooth dough.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Shape the Rasgullas:</b><br>
                            Divide the chenna dough into small equal-sized portions and roll them between your palms to make smooth balls. Ensure there are no cracks. They will double in size when cooked, so keep that in mind when shaping.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Rasgullas:</b><br>
                            In a large pot, bring water and sugar to a boil. Stir until the sugar dissolves completely.
                            Gently add the chenna balls to the boiling sugar syrup. Cover with a lid and cook on medium heat for about 15-20 minutes. The rasgullas will puff up and double in size.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Finish:</b><br>
                            Turn off the heat and let the rasgullas cool in the syrup for at least an hour.
                            Optionally, add saffron strands, rose water, or cardamom for flavor before serving.
                            Serve Rasgullas chilled or at room temperature.
