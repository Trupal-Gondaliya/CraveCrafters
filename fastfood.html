                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Patties:</b><br>
                            In a large mixing bowl, mash the chickpeas or black beans with a fork or potato masher until mostly smooth, leaving some chunks for texture.
                            Add the breadcrumbs, grated carrots, chopped onions, bell peppers, minced garlic, parsley or cilantro, soy sauce, tomato paste or ketchup, cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
                            If the mixture is too dry, add a little water or more tomato paste/ketchup. If it's too wet, add more breadcrumbs.
                            Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into patties.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Patties:</b><br>
                            Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.
                            Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside. Be gentle when flipping them to avoid breaking.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Assembling the Burgers:</b><br>
                            Lightly toast the burger buns on a skillet or in the oven.
                            Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each bun.
                            Add the cooked veggie patty on top of the lettuce.
                            Layer with tomato slices, onion slices, pickles, and cheese slices (if using).
                            Spread ketchup, mustard, or your favorite burger sauce on the top half of the bun.
                            Place the top bun over the assembled burger.<br><Br>

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparation:</b><br>
                            Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F).
                            Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with oil.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cutting the Potatoes:</b><br>
                            Wash and peel the potatoes (you can leave the skin on if you prefer).
                            Cut the potatoes into even-sized sticks, about 1/4 inch thick.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Soaking the Potatoes:</b><br>
                            Place the cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water and let them soak for at least 30 minutes. This helps remove excess starch and makes the fries crispier.
                            After soaking, drain the potatoes and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Seasoning the Potatoes:</b><br>
                            In a large bowl, toss the dried potato sticks with vegetable oil, making sure they are evenly coated.
                            Add salt and any optional seasonings you like, and toss again to coat evenly.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Baking the Fries:</b><br>
                            Spread the potato sticks in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Make sure they are not touching each other for even cooking.
                            Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, flipping the fries halfway through, until they are golden brown and crispy.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Once baked, remove the fries from the oven and let them cool slightly.
                            Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
                            Serve the fries hot with ketchup, mayonnaise, or your favorite dipping sauce.

                            Gradually add water and knead into a smooth dough.

                            Add chopped onions and green chili (if using). Sauté until onions turn translucent.
                            Add turmeric powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well.

                            Divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle (like a chapati) using a rolling pin.
                            Heat a tawa or griddle over medium heat. Cook the rolled dough circle on both sides until light golden brown spots appear. Remove and keep aside.
                            Place a cooked dough circle on a clean surface. Spread some tomato ketchup or chutney over it (optional).
                            Place a portion of the potato filling in the center of the dough circle. Sprinkle some grated cheese and chopped coriander leaves over the filling.
                            Fold the sides of the dough circle over the filling, covering it completely to form a roll.
                            Heat a little oil or ghee on the tawa or griddle. Place the assembled Frankie seam-side down and cook until golden brown and crisp on both sides. Repeat for remaining Frankies.<br><br>

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cook the Pasta:</b><br>
                            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
                            Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
                            Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta. Set aside.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Prepare the Tomato Sauce:</b><br>
                            Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
                            Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 5-7 minutes.
                            Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
                            Add the crushed tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes), dried oregano, dried basil, and red pepper flakes if using. Stir to combine.
                            Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add some of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.
                            Season the sauce with sugar (if using), salt, and pepper to taste.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Combine Pasta and Sauce:</b><br>
                            Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If needed, add more reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce and help it cling to the pasta.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Divide the pasta among serving plates.
                            Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
                            Serve immediately with a side of garlic bread or a simple salad.

                            In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.
                            In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
                            Mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour a little at a time until it is manageable.
                            Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
                            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours or until doubled in size.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Sauce:</b><br>
                            In a bowl, mix together the tomato sauce, dried oregano, dried basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasoning to taste.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Assembling the Pizza:</b><br>
                            Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or an inverted baking sheet inside to heat.
                            Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions for two pizzas or keep it whole for one large pizza.
                            On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to your desired thickness.
                            Transfer the rolled-out dough to a piece of parchment paper for easy transfer to the oven.
                            Spread a thin layer of the prepared pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
                            Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Baking the Pizza:</b><br>
                            Carefully transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet.
                            Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
                            Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.<br><br>

                            Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Prepare the Filling:</b><br>
                            Heat vegetable oil (and sesame oil if using) in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.
                            Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.
                            Add chopped cabbage, grated carrots, bell peppers, and spring onions. Stir-fry for 5-6 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.
                            Add soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
                            Remove from heat and let the filling cool completely.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Assemble the Momos:</b><br>
                            Divide the rested dough into small lemon-sized balls and roll each ball into a smooth ball.
                            Roll out each ball into a thin circle of about 3-4 inches in diameter, using a rolling pin and a lightly floured surface.
                            Place a spoonful of the cooled vegetable filling in the center of each circle.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Shape the Momos:</b><br>
                            To shape the momos, start pleating and folding the edges of the circle towards the center, forming small pleats as you go around. Pinch the edges together to seal the momo. You can also create different shapes like half-moon or crescent shapes.
                            Repeat with the remaining dough and filling to make more momos.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Steam the Momos:</b><br>
                            Grease a steamer basket or line it with cabbage leaves to prevent sticking.
                            Arrange the momos in the steamer basket, leaving some space between them to expand during steaming.
                            Steam the momos over boiling water for about 10-12 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through and the filling is hot and cooked.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serve:</b><br>
                            Serve the hot momos immediately with a dipping sauce made of soy sauce mixed with vinegar, chili sauce or chopped fresh chilies, and chopped cilantro if desired.
                            Enjoy your delicious vegetarian momos as a snack or appetizer!

                            In a blender or food processor, combine tamarind pulp, mint leaves, cilantro leaves, green chilies, and ginger. Blend until smooth.
                            Strain the mixture using a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl to remove any solids.
                            Add roasted cumin powder, chaat masala, black salt, regular salt, and cold water to the strained mixture. Mix well and adjust seasoning according to taste.
                            Chill the pani in the refrigerator until ready to use.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Prepare the Puri (Crispy Shells):</b><br>
                            In a mixing bowl, combine semolina and all-purpose flour.
                            Gradually add water and knead into a stiff dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.
                            Divide the dough into small balls and roll each ball into a thin circle (about 2 inches in diameter).
                            Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat.
                            Fry the rolled circles of dough until they puff up and turn golden brown. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Repeat with remaining dough.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Prepare the Filling:</b><br>
                            In a bowl, mix boiled and mashed potatoes with chaat masala and salt. Adjust seasoning to taste.
                            Optionally, mix in boiled chickpeas for added texture.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Assemble the Pani Puri:</b><br>
                            Make a small hole in the center of each puri by tapping it gently with your thumb or using a spoon handle.
                            Fill each puri with a spoonful of potato filling and chickpeas (if using).
                            Dip each filled puri into the chilled pani and serve immediately.
                            Optionally, garnish with tamarind chutney, green chutney, sev, and finely chopped onions.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serve:</b><br>
                            Serve Pani Puri immediately after assembling, as the puris tend to get soggy if left for too long.
