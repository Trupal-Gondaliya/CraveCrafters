                            <b class="recipehighlight">Boiling and Preparing Potatoes:</b><br>
                            Wash the baby potatoes thoroughly. Boil them until they are just tender. Once cooled, peel them and prick them with a fork or toothpick all over. This helps the potatoes absorb the flavors of the gravy.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making the Gravy:</b><br>
                            Heat oil or ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai over medium heat.
                            Add cumin seeds, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, green cardamom pods, and cloves. Sauté for a few seconds until they become aromatic.
                            Add finely chopped onion and sauté until it turns golden brown.
                            Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.
                            Add Kashmiri red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well and cook the spices for a minute.
                            Add tomato puree and cook until the oil separates from the masala mixture.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Potatoes:</b><br>
                            Lower the heat and add whisked yogurt. Stir continuously to avoid curdling.
                            Add water as needed to adjust the consistency of the gravy.
                            Add boiled and peeled baby potatoes to the gravy. Mix gently to coat the potatoes with the masala.
                            Cover the pan with a lid and simmer on low heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes absorb the flavors of the gravy.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Finishing Touches:</b><br>
                            Add garam masala and mix well. Adjust salt and spice levels according to your taste.
                            Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Optional: Drizzle some fresh cream and sprinkle kasuri methi (crushed between palms) for added flavor.</b><br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve Dum Aloo hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice.
                            Enjoy the rich and aromatic flavors of this classic Indian dish!

                            Rinse the soaked rajma under running water until the water runs clear.
                            Pressure cook rajma with enough water (about 3 cups) and a pinch of salt until they are tender. This usually takes about 15-20 minutes after the cooker reaches full pressure. You can also cook them in a pot until tender if you don't have a pressure cooker.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making Kashmiri Rajma:</b><br>
                            Heat ghee or oil in a pan over medium heat.
                            Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
                            Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
                            Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Adding Spices:</b><br>
                            Add Kashmiri red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, fennel powder, dry ginger powder, and garam masala. Mix well and cook the spices for a minute until fragrant.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Curry:</b><br>
                            Add tomato puree and cook until the oil separates from the masala mixture.
                            Add cooked rajma along with its cooking water (or fresh water as needed). Mix well.
                            Season with salt according to taste. Bring the curry to a boil.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Simmering:</b><br>
                            Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a lid, and simmer the Kashmiri Rajma for 15-20 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the rajma to absorb the spices.<br><br>

                            Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves.
