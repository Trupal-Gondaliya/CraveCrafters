                            <b class="recipehighlight">For the Idli  Recipe:</b><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparation:</b><br>
                            Wash the rice and urad dal separately a few times under running water until the water runs clear.
                            Soak the rice and urad dal separately in enough water. Let them soak for at least 4-6 hours, or overnight.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Grinding:</b><br>
                            Drain the water from the soaked urad dal. Grind it in a blender or wet grinder with a little water until it becomes a smooth and fluffy batter. This may take about 10-15 minutes of grinding, scraping the sides as needed.
                            Transfer the ground urad dal batter into a large bowl.
                            Drain the water from the soaked rice and grind it to a slightly coarse texture, adding water as needed. The rice batter should be smooth yet slightly grainy.
                            Combine the rice batter with the urad dal batter in the bowl. Mix well using your hands or a spoon to incorporate both batters thoroughly.
                            Add salt to taste and mix well again.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Fermentation:</b><br>
                            Cover the bowl with a lid or a cloth and let the batter ferment in a warm place for about 8-12 hours or overnight. The batter should rise and become fluffy.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Steaming:</b><br>
                            Grease the idli molds or plates with oil or ghee.
                            Mix the batter gently. Pour spoonfuls of the batter into each mold, filling them almost to the top.
                            Place the idli stand in a steamer or a large pot with boiling water. Steam the idlis on medium-high heat for about 10-12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the idlis comes out clean.
                            Once done, remove the idli stand from the steamer and let it cool for a few minutes.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Carefully remove the idlis from the molds using a spoon or knife.
                            Serve hot idlis with sambar, coconut chutney, or any chutney of your choice.

                            Wash the rice, urad dal, and flattened rice (poha) separately under running water until the water runs clear.
                            Soak the rice and urad dal together in enough water. Soak the flattened rice (poha) separately. Let them soak for at least 4-6 hours, or overnight.<br><br>

                            Drain the water from the soaked rice and flattened rice (poha). Grind them to a smooth batter, adding water as needed. The batter should be slightly coarse yet smooth.
                            Combine the rice and flattened rice batter with the urad dal batter in the bowl. Mix well using your hands or a spoon to incorporate both batters thoroughly.
                            Add salt to taste and mix well again.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Fermentation:</b><br>
                            Cover the bowl with a lid or a cloth and let the batter ferment in a warm place for about 8-12 hours or overnight. The batter should rise and become slightly bubbly.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making Dosas:</b><br>
                            After fermentation, mix the batter gently.
                            Heat a non-stick or cast-iron dosa tava (griddle) over medium-high heat. Once hot, reduce the heat to medium.
                            Grease the tava lightly with oil or ghee.
                            Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the tava.
                            Quickly spread the batter in a circular motion using the back of the ladle to form a thin, even layer.
                            Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa and on top if desired.
                            Cook the dosa until the edges start to brown and crisp up, and the surface looks cooked (about 1-2 minutes).
                            Flip the dosa carefully using a spatula and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes, or until it is cooked through and lightly golden brown.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Fold the dosa in half or roll it up and serve hot with sambar, coconut chutney, or any chutney of your choice.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparation:</b><br>
                            Ensure the dosa batter is well fermented. If it's too thick, add a little water to achieve a thick pouring consistency.
                            Heat a non-stick pan or a cast iron skillet (tava) on medium heat. Grease it lightly with oil or ghee.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making Uttapam:</b><br>
                            Take a ladleful of dosa batter and pour it onto the center of the heated pan.
                            Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to make a thick pancake-like shape, about 5-6 inches in diameter.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Adding Toppings:</b><br>
                            Immediately sprinkle chopped onions, tomatoes, green chilies (if using), and coriander leaves evenly over the Uttapam.
                            Lightly press the toppings into the batter with the back of the ladle.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking:</b><br>
                            Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges of the Uttapam.
                            Cover and cook on medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the bottom turns golden brown and crisp.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Flipping:</b><br>
                            Gently flip the Uttapam using a spatula. Cook the other side uncovered for another 2-3 minutes, or until it is cooked through.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serve:</b><br>
                            Once both sides are cooked and golden brown, transfer the Uttapam to a plate.
                            Serve hot with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, or sambar.
