                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Dough:</b><br>
                            In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.
                            Add the yogurt and mix well.
                            Add oil or ghee and mix until the flour mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
                            Gradually add water and knead the dough until it is smooth and soft.
                            Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 2-3 hours.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Rolling the Bhature:</b><br>
                            After the dough has rested, divide it into small lemon-sized balls.
                            Roll each ball into a smooth ball and flatten it slightly with your hands.
                            On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball into a circular shape about 5-6 inches in diameter. The thickness should be about 1/4 inch.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Frying the Bhature:</b><br>
                            Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-high heat.
                            To check if the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of dough into the oil. If it rises to the surface quickly and puffs up, the oil is ready.
                            Carefully slide one rolled bhature into the hot oil. It should puff up immediately.
                            Gently press the bhature with a slotted spoon to help it puff up fully.
                            Fry until both sides are golden brown, then remove the bhature with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
                            Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve the hot and fluffy Bhature immediately with Chole, pickle, and onions on the side.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Dough:</b><br>
                            In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt.
                            Add the yogurt and oil or ghee. Mix well.
                            Gradually add milk and knead the dough until it is smooth and soft.
                            Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 1-2 hours.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Shaping the Kulcha:</b><br>
                            After the dough has rested, divide it into small lemon-sized balls.
                            Roll each ball into a smooth ball and flatten it slightly with your hands.
                            On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball into an oval or round shape about 6-7 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick.
                            Sprinkle nigella seeds or sesame seeds and chopped coriander leaves on top of each kulcha and gently press them into the dough with a rolling pin.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Kulcha:</b><br>
                            Heat a tawa or griddle over medium-high heat.
                            Place a rolled-out kulcha on the hot tawa. Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface.
                            Flip the kulcha and cook until the other side is golden brown and cooked through. You can brush some butter or ghee on the cooked kulcha for extra flavor.
                            Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve hot kulchas with chole, curry, or any side dish of your choice.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Paneer:</b>
                            <br>In a pan, heat the butter and oil over medium heat.
                            Add the paneer cubes and lightly fry them until golden brown. Remove and set aside.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Gravy:</b>
                            <br>In the same pan, add a little more butter if needed. Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter.
                            Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
                            Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies (if using). Sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw smell goes away.
                            Add the tomato puree and cook until the oil starts to separate from the mixture.
                            Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
                            Add the cashew paste and cook for a few minutes until the gravy thickens and becomes creamy.<br>

                            <br>Add the tomato ketchup or tomato paste (if using) and mix well.
                            Add the fried paneer cubes to the gravy and simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the paneer to absorb the flavors.
                            Stir in the fresh cream and mix well.
                            Crush the kasuri methi between your palms and add it to the gravy.
                            Add garam masala and mix well. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, adjusting the seasoning as needed.<br>
