                            Wash and prepare all the fruits as needed. Peel, slice, and dice them into bite-sized pieces.<br><br>

                            <br>2 pounds potatoes (preferably waxy varieties like Yukon Gold or red potatoes)
                            <br>1/2 cup mayonnaise (use vegan mayo for vegan version)
                            <br>1/4 cup finely chopped celery

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Boil the Potatoes:</b><br>
                            Wash the potatoes thoroughly and place them in a large pot. Cover with cold water and add a pinch of salt.
                            Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes depending on the size of the potatoes.
                            Drain the potatoes and let them cool slightly until they are cool enough to handle.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Prepare the Dressing:</b><br>
                            In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise (or vegan mayo) and Dijon mustard until smooth and well combined. Adjust the amount of mayo and mustard to taste.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Assemble the Potato Salad:</b><br>
                            Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle but still warm, peel off the skins if desired (optional) and cut them into bite-sized cubes.
                            Place the cubed potatoes in a large mixing bowl. Add chopped celery, chopped red onion, and chopped parsley.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Combine and Season:</b><br>
                            Pour the prepared dressing over the potato mixture. Gently toss everything together until the potatoes and other ingredients are evenly coated with the dressing.
                            Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Adjust seasoning as needed.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Chill and Serve:</b><br>
                            Cover the potato salad with plastic wrap or transfer to a serving bowl. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld together.
                            Before serving, sprinkle with paprika for garnish if desired.
