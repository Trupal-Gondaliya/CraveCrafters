                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparation:</b><br>
                            Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease a cake tin or line it with parchment paper.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Mixing Dry Ingredients:</b><br>
                            In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well and set aside.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Mixing Wet Ingredients:</b><br>
                            In another bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and oil (or melted butter) until well combined and slightly fluffy. Add vanilla essence and mix again.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Combining the Mixtures:</b><br>
                            Gradually add the flour mixture and milk alternately to the wet ingredients, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until smooth and no lumps remain.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Baking:</b><br>
                            Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin. Tap the tin gently to remove any air bubbles.
                            Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooling:</b><br>
                            Once baked, remove from the oven and let it cool in the tin for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serve:</b><br>

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparation:</b><br>
                            Preheat your oven to 160°C (320°F). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making the Crust:</b><br>
                            In a mixing bowl, combine the crushed digestive biscuits, melted butter, and sugar. Mix until the crumbs are well-coated with butter.
                            Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared springform pan. Use the back of a spoon or a flat-bottomed glass to press it down firmly.
                            Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove and let it cool while you prepare the filling.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making the Cheesecake Filling:</b><br>
                            In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy.
                            Add the powdered sugar and continue to beat until well combined.
                            Add the heavy cream, cornstarch, vanilla essence, and lemon juice. Beat until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Make sure there are no lumps.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Baking the Cheesecake:</b><br>
                            Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust and spread it evenly.
                            Tap the pan gently on the counter to remove any air bubbles.
                            Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly. The cheesecake will continue to set as it cools.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooling:</b><br>
                            Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside the oven with the door slightly open for about an hour.
                            Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Then, refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to set completely.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Once the cheesecake is fully set, run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen it. Remove the sides of the springform pan.
                            Top with fresh fruits, fruit compote, or chocolate ganache if desired.
                            Slice and serve your delicious eggless cheesecake!

                            Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with cooking spray or a little oil.
                            Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.
                            Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining batter.<br><br>

                            In another bowl, whisk together the milk, oil or melted butter, and vanilla essence until smooth.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Combining the Mixtures:</b><br>
                            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.
                            Warm the Nutella slightly to make it easier to mix. Add the Nutella to the batter and gently fold it in, creating swirls of Nutella.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Pancakes:</b><br>
                            Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with cooking spray or a little oil.
                            Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.
                            Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining batter.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve the pancakes warm with a drizzle of Nutella on top. You can also add sliced bananas, strawberries, or a dusting of powdered sugar for extra indulgence.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">For the Red Velvet Cake Recipe:</b><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparation:</b><br>
                            Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Mixing Dry Ingredients:</b><br>
                            In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt. Mix well and set aside.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Mixing Wet Ingredients:</b><br>
                            In another bowl, whisk together the oil, buttermilk, red food coloring, vanilla essence, and vinegar until well combined.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Combining the Mixtures:</b><br>
                            Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Baking the Cake:</b><br>
                            Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
                            Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
                            Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making the Cream Cheese Frosting:</b><br>
                            In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy.
                            Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
                            Add the vanilla essence and continue to beat until the frosting is light and fluffy.<br><Br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Assembling the Cake:</b><br>
                            Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous amount of cream cheese frosting on top.
                            Place the second cake layer on top and spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Decorate as desired and serve your delicious eggless red velvet cake!
