                            <br>2 cups heavy cream
                            <br>1 cup whole milk
                            <br>3/4 cup granulated sugar
                            <br>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
                            <br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                            <br>Pinch of salt

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Prepare the Ice Cream Base:</b><br>
                            In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt.
                            Whisk the mixture over medium heat until it is smooth and the sugar and cocoa powder have dissolved completely.
                            Bring the mixture just to a simmer, stirring frequently. Remove from heat.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooling the Mixture:</b><br>
                            Stir in the vanilla extract.
                            Let the mixture cool to room temperature. You can speed up this process by placing the saucepan in a larger bowl filled with ice water and stirring occasionally.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Churning the Ice Cream:</b><br>
                            Once cooled, pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.
                            If using chocolate chips or chopped chocolate, add them during the last few minutes of churning to distribute evenly.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Freezing the Ice Cream:</b><br>
                            Transfer the churned ice cream into a freezer-safe container.
                            Smooth the top with a spatula and cover tightly with a lid or plastic wrap directly touching the surface of the ice cream.
                            Freeze for at least 4-6 hours, or until firm.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Remove the chocolate ice cream from the freezer a few minutes before serving to soften slightly.
                            Scoop into bowls or cones, and enjoy your homemade chocolate ice cream!

                            <br>cup granulated sugar
                            <br>1/2 cup light corn syrup

                            <b class="recipehighlight">For the Blueberry Candy Recipe:</b><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Prepare the Candy Mixture:</b><br>
                            In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine granulated sugar, light corn syrup, and water over medium heat.
                            Stir until the sugar dissolves completely.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Candy:</b><br>
                            Insert a candy thermometer into the mixture and continue to cook without stirring until it reaches 300°F (hard crack stage) on the candy thermometer. This will take about 10-15 minutes.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Adding Flavor and Color:</b><br>
                            Once the mixture reaches 300°F, remove the saucepan from heat.
                            Stir in the blueberry extract (or flavoring of your choice) and blue food coloring (if using), mixing well to distribute evenly. Be cautious as the mixture will be very hot.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Shaping the Candy:</b><br>
                            Pour the hot candy mixture onto a parchment-lined baking sheet or a heatproof surface dusted with powdered sugar.
                            Allow the candy to cool slightly until it is cool enough to handle but still pliable.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Forming Candy Shapes:</b><br>
                            Grease your hands with a little butter or oil to prevent sticking.
                            Pull and stretch the candy mixture to aerate it. Fold it over itself and pull again until it becomes smooth and shiny.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cutting or Shaping:</b><br>
                            Roll the candy into a long rope and cut it into small pieces with scissors or a sharp knife. Alternatively, you can use candy molds to shape the candy.
                            Dust the candy pieces lightly with powdered sugar to prevent sticking.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooling and Storing:</b><br>
                            Let the blueberry candy pieces cool completely at room temperature until they harden.
                            Store the candies in an airtight container at room temperature. They should keep well for several weeks.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Prepare the Ice Cream Base:</b><br>
                            In a mixing bowl, combine heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, vanilla extract (or vanilla bean seeds), and a pinch of salt. Mix until the sugar is dissolved.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Chilling the Mixture:</b><br>
                            Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight. Chilling helps the flavors to meld and ensures a smoother texture.<br><br>

                            Smooth the top with a spatula and cover tightly with a lid or plastic wrap directly touching the surface of the ice cream to prevent ice crystals from forming.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Final Freezing:</b><br>
                            Freeze the vanilla ice cream for at least 4-6 hours, or until firm and scoopable.<br><br>
