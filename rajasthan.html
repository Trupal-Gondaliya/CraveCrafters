                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing Baati Dough:</b>
                            In a mixing bowl, combine whole wheat flour, semolina, melted ghee, and salt.
                            Gradually add water and knead into a stiff dough. Let it rest for 15-20 minutes.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Shaping and Baking Baati:</b><br>
                            Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
                            Divide the dough into equal-sized balls and shape them into rounds or elongated shapes.
                            Place the shaped baatis on a baking tray and bake for 35-40 minutes or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Alternatively, you can also deep-fry or roast them over charcoal for a traditional flavor.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing Dal:</b><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking Dal:</b><br>
                            In a pressure cooker or a deep pan, add soaked tuvar dal along with chopped tomatoes, green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt.
                            Add enough water to cover the dal (about 3 cups). Pressure cook for 3-4 whistles or cook until the dal is soft and cooked through.
                            Once cooked, mash the dal slightly with the back of a spoon or a masher.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Tempering Dal:</b><br>
                            In a small pan, heat ghee. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
                            Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
                            Add a pinch of asafoetida and pour this tempering over the cooked dal. Mix well.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Garnish and Serve:</b><br>
                            Garnish the dal with chopped coriander leaves.
                            Serve hot baatis with dal, garnished with more ghee if desired, and lemon wedges on the side.

                            In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, semolina, ghee or oil, and a pinch of salt.
                            Gradually add water and knead into a smooth, stiff dough. Cover and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.<br><br>

                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Filling:</b><br>
                            Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add fennel seeds and cumin seeds, let them crackle.
                            Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
                            Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the spices are well incorporated into the onions.
                            Remove from heat and let the filling cool completely.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Shaping and Frying Kachoris:</b><br>
                            Divide the dough into equal-sized balls. Roll out each ball into a small circle, about 3-4 inches in diameter.
                            Place a tablespoon of the cooled onion filling in the center of each circle.
                            Gather the edges of the circle to form a pleated pattern, sealing the filling inside. Gently flatten the filled ball.
                            Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.
                            Once the oil is hot, gently slide in the kachoris, a few at a time. Fry them on low to medium heat until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides.
                            Remove the fried kachoris using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.

                            In a large mixing bowl, sift the all-purpose flour (maida) to ensure there are no lumps.
                            Add melted ghee and mix well using your fingers, until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
                            Gradually add chilled water, a little at a time, and mix to form a smooth batter. The consistency should be thin, like pancake batter.
                            Optionally, add a pinch of cardamom powder for flavor. Mix well.
                            Add a few ice cubes to keep the batter chilled.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Frying Ghevar:</b><br>
                            Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat.
                            Take a round mold with holes (like a small sieve) and place it in the hot ghee.
                            Pour a ladleful of batter through the mold into the hot ghee, slowly and steadily, ensuring it forms a round shape with a hollow center.
                            Fry the ghevar on medium-low heat until it turns golden and crisp. Gently press down with the back of a spoon to release excess ghee or oil from the center.
                            Remove the fried ghevar carefully using tongs or a slotted spoon. Drain excess oil and place it on paper towels to absorb any remaining oil.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing Sugar Syrup:</b><br>
                            In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves.
                            Add saffron strands (if using) and cardamom powder. Mix well and simmer for 5-7 minutes until the syrup thickens slightly.
                            Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Soaking Ghevar:</b><br>
                            Place the fried ghevar in a deep dish.
                            Pour the warm sugar syrup over the ghevar, ensuring it is soaked well from all sides. Let it soak for about 10-15 minutes.
                            Garnish with slivered almonds and pistachios (if using).<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve Ghevar warm or at room temperature. It can be enjoyed on its own or with a side of rabri (sweetened thickened milk).

                            <b class="recipehighlight">For the Gatte Ki Sabji Recipe:</b><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing Gatte Dough:</b><br>
                            In a mixing bowl, combine besan, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, asafoetida, salt, and ghee or oil.
                            Mix well and knead into a stiff dough using water, a little at a time.
                            Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion into long cylindrical shapes (about 1/2 inch thick).<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Boiling Gatte:</b><br>
                            Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the rolled gatte pieces and boil for about 10-12 minutes or until they float to the top and are cooked through.
                            Remove the boiled gatte from water and let them cool slightly. Cut them into small pieces or slices.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing Yogurt Mixture:</b><br>
                            In a bowl, whisk yogurt (curd) until smooth. Add besan and whisk again until well combined. Keep aside.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Gravy:</b><br>
                            Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and asafoetida. Let them splutter.
                            Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
                            Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.
                            Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.
                            Lower the heat and add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. Mix well and cook the spices for a minute.
                            Gradually add the whisked yogurt-besan mixture, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
                            Add salt to taste and bring the gravy to a gentle boil. Cook on low heat for 7-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the gravy thickens slightly.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Adding Gatte:</b><br>
                            Add the boiled gatte pieces to the gravy. Mix gently, ensuring the gatte are well coated with the gravy.
                            Simmer for another 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together.
                            Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve Gatte ki Sabji hot with steamed rice or roti. It pairs well with a side of pickles or salad.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">For the Bajra Roti Recipe:</b><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing the Dough:</b><br>
                            In a mixing bowl, take bajra flour (pearl millet flour). You can optionally add a pinch of salt for taste.
                            Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead to form a smooth and stiff dough. Bajra flour tends to be a bit crumbly, so add water cautiously to achieve the right consistency. The dough should be firm enough to handle, but not too dry.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Rolling the Rotis:</b><br>
                            Divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls.
                            Take one ball of dough and flatten it slightly with your palms.
                            Dust it with some bajra flour to prevent sticking, and then roll it out gently into a round roti using a rolling pin. Aim for a thickness of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Bajra rotis are typically thicker than wheat rotis.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking the Rotis:</b><br>
                            Heat a tava or griddle over medium-high heat.
                            Once the tava is hot, gently place the rolled bajra roti on it.
                            Cook for about a minute or until you see bubbles forming on the surface.
                            Flip the roti and cook the other side. Press gently with a spatula to ensure even cooking.
                            Brush ghee or oil on both sides of the roti. Cook until both sides are golden brown and cooked through.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Remove the bajra roti from the tava and serve hot with a dollop of ghee, fresh yogurt, or any curry of your choice.
                            Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls to make more rotis.

                            <br>1 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
                            <br>1 cup ghee (clarified butter)

                            <b class="recipehighlight">For the Moong Dal Halwa Recipe:</b><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Preparing Moong Dal:</b><br>
                            Rinse moong dal thoroughly under running water until the water runs clear.
                            Soak the moong dal in enough water for 4-5 hours or overnight.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making Moong Dal Paste:</b><br>
                            Drain the soaked moong dal and grind it into a coarse paste without adding water. It should be a slightly grainy texture, not too fine.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking Moong Dal:</b>
                            Heat 2 tablespoons of ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai over medium heat.
                            Add the ground moong dal paste and roast it in ghee, stirring continuously to prevent burning. Roast until it turns golden brown and you can smell a nutty aroma. This process can take about 15-20 minutes.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Making Halwa:</b><br>
                            In a separate pan, heat milk until it boils.
                            Gradually add the hot milk to the roasted moong dal paste, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
                            Cook the mixture on low heat, stirring constantly until the moong dal absorbs the milk and becomes thick.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Adding Sugar and Flavoring:</b><br>
                            Add sugar and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the sugar melts and the halwa starts to thicken again.
                            Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using), mix well.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Adding Ghee:</b><br>
                            Gradually add the remaining ghee, a tablespoon at a time, while continuously stirring the halwa. This step is crucial for the richness and texture of the halwa.
                            Cook the halwa until it starts to leave the sides of the pan and ghee begins to ooze out. This process can take about 20-25 minutes on low heat.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Garnishing:</b><br>
                            Once the halwa reaches the desired consistency and ghee separates, remove it from heat.
                            Garnish with chopped nuts like almonds, cashews, and pistachios.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serving:</b><br>
                            Serve Moong Dal Halwa hot or warm. It can be enjoyed on its own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a delightful contrast.
