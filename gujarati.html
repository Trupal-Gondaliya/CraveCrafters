                            <br>Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed pan or kadai and bring it to a boil over medium heat.Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer.<br>

                            <br>Keep stirring the milk occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom and sides of the pan.As the milk thickens and reduces, a layer of cream (malai) will form on the surface. Gently stir this cream back into the milk.Continue this process for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the milk is reduced to about half its original volume and has thickened.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Add Sugar and Flavorings:</b>
                            <br>Add the sugar to the thickened milk and stir well until it dissolves completely.Add the cardamom powder and saffron milk (if using). Mix well.<br>

                            <br>Add the chopped almonds, cashews, pistachios, chironji nuts, raisins, dried figs, and dried apricots. Stir well to combine.Let the mixture simmer for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.<br>

                            Once the sugar dissolves, add saffron threads (if using), cardamom powder, and lemon juice.
                            Let the syrup simmer until it reaches a one-string consistency (when you touch the syrup between your thumb and forefinger, it should form a single thread).
                            Remove from heat and add a few drops of rose water (if using). Keep the syrup warm.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Frying the Jalebis:</b>

                            Squeeze the batter into the hot oil in a spiral shape, starting from the center and working outward. Fry a few jalebis at a time.
                            Fry the jalebis until they are golden and crispy on both sides, turning occasionally with tongs.<br>

                            Remove the jalebis from the syrup and place them on a plate or tray.<br>
                            <br><b class="recipehighlight">Serve:</b>
