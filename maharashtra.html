                            In a pan, heat jaggery or sugar with a little water until it melts and forms a syrup.
                            Add mashed chana dal, cardamom powder, and nutmeg powder (if using). Cook until the mixture thickens and comes together.

                            Cook on medium-low heat until the jaggery melts and mixes well with the coconut, forming a sticky mixture.
                            Add cardamom powder for flavor and mix thoroughly. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Shaping the Modaks:</b><br>
                            Take a small portion of the dough and knead it gently. Divide it into small balls.
                            Grease your palms with ghee or oil. Take one ball of dough and flatten it into a small disc.
                            Place a spoonful of the coconut-jaggery filling in the center of the disc.
                            Pinch the edges of the disc together to seal the filling inside, shaping it into a cone or a modak shape. Use your fingers to create pleats on the top if desired.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Steaming:</b><br>
                            Prepare a steamer and grease the steaming plate or tray with ghee or oil.
                            Place the modaks on the greased plate and steam them for about 10-12 minutes on medium heat until they are cooked through and shiny.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Serve:</b><br>
                            Allow the modaks to cool slightly before removing them from the steamer.
                            Offer them as prasad (offering) to Lord Ganesha during Ganesh Chaturthi or enjoy them as a sweet treat.

                            <b class="recipehighlight">reparing Poha:</b><br>
                            Rinse the poha under running water in a sieve or colander until it becomes soft. Drain all the water and let the poha sit for about 10 minutes to soften further.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Cooking:</b><br>
                            Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
                            Add cumin seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves. Sauté for a few seconds until fragrant.
                            Add finely chopped onions and green chilies. Sauté until the onions turn translucent.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Adding Poha:</b><br>
                            Lower the heat and add turmeric powder and salt to the onions. Mix well.
                            Add the soaked poha and gently mix everything together using a spatula. Be careful not to break the poha.
                            Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the poha is heated through and well combined with the spices.<br><br>
                            <b class="recipehighlight">Garnish and Serve:</b><br>
                            Add roasted peanuts and mix well.
                            Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and freshly grated coconut, if using.
                            Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the pohe.
